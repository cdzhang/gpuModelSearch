GPU Model Search

Objective: Create CUDA C code to perform linear regression model search.

Details:
- Select covariates in a linear regression model that maximize AIC, BIC, 
  or marginal likelihood.
- How large can n and p be while enumerating all models?
- If models cannot be enumerated, how can we efficiently search through a 
  subset of models to hope that we have found the best. E.g. greedy search. 

Bonus:
- Callable from R, perhaps specifying a data file to be read directly into C.
- Perform model averaging for prediction.

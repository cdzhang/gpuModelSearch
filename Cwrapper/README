The following commands compile the source into the shared library filed that R can call:
(in lieu of a makefile)

nvcc -g -G -I/apps/lib64/R/include -I/home/simpsonm/gpuModelSearch/gputools/src -Xcompiler "-Wall -Wextra -fpic" -c lmsearch.cu -o lmsearch.o

nvcc -shared -lcublas lmsearch.o cuseful.o lsfit.o qrdecomp.o -o lmsearch.so

note that "simpsonm" above should be replaced by your own ISU username (assuming you're compiling from impact1).

JBN: in trying to use the above (after changing to my username) to compile, 
     I received the following errors:

lmsearch.cu:7:21: error: cuseful.h: No such file or directory
lmsearch.cu:8:19: error: lsfit.h: No such file or directory
lmsearch.cu:9:22: error: qrdecomp.h: No such file or directory

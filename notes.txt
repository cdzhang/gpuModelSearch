This is a collections of notes to myself (e.g. Matt)

Things to look into:
- See how gpuTools implements matrix operations and other things
- implement a function which takes a set of covariates and uses
gpuTools to fit all possible regression models, then computes AIC and
BIC to compare them (if it hasn't been done)
- familiarize myself with GSL and other libraries
- stop wasting time fiddling with emacs

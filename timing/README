timing.r contains an R script for timing all of the various functions with different numbers of rows and columns in the full model matrix. Use make to run this script and output fittime.csv, containing the timing information.

note: timing.Rnw is NOT a Sweave file - it's a knitr file. Calling Sweave
on it probably won't work and knitr should be used instead. The following
script will create the tex file, which can be compiled normally like any
tex file (in R):

library(knitr) ##install from CRAN using install.packages("knitr") if necessary
knit("timing.Rnw") ##creates tex file

In order to compile the resulting timing.tex, the bibtex file gpubib.bib is required.

"make" will create the device reset function and run all of the timings in the background using nohup.	NOTE: THIS MUST BE DONE IN THE SERVER'S SHELL, NOT EMACS ESHELL.

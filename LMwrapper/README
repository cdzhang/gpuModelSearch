This library calls a wrapper written in R to fit all possible sub-models from a full model matrix. The wrapper pulls out the appropriate columns of the full model matrix and passes them to the base R function lm.fit to actually fit the model, then does some housekeeping to keep track of AIC, BIC, logMarginalLikelihood and so forth. This wrapper is used as a baseline for comparing all of the other wrappers.

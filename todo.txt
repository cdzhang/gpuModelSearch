To Do List (to be updated at the end of every day for the next day):


1. Find out why the C wrapper is so slow and try to speed it up.

2. Look for more ways to improve the C Smart wrapper.

3. re-time the C and R wrappers and time the C Smart wrapper for the first time; summarize the results - use cudaDeviceReset() to automate the process.
